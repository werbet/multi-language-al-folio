My name is **Eriko Werbet** and this is my personal website. I have been working in the technology industry for 28 years — initially as a **software engineer** and later as a **solutions architect** (technical pre-sales, and internal and external consulting). I also worked as a **university professor** for 10 years and I’m deeply passionate about **Science, Technology, Innovation, and Education**, which I believe are the pillars for building a fairer and more equitable society.

After nearly 30 years of continuous professional dedication, I decided to take a strategic sabbatical in 2024. This period has been incredibly enriching both personally and professionally. I had the opportunity to:

- Explore and appreciate various regions of my home country, Brazil, expanding my cultural perspective.
- Develop new culinary skills, especially in Brazilian, Chinese, and Japanese cuisines.
- Independently study **generative AI**, since I'm very interested in its applications.
- Begin an **MBA in Data Science and Analytics** at the University of São Paulo (USP), deepening my expertise in Artificial Intelligence and data-driven innovation.

It's 2025, and I'm looking for a new job — something that will provide me as much motivation and fulfillment as my previous roles.
